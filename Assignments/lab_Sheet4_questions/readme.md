## Ambiguity:

#### In OOP ambiguity means duplication of members due to inheritance, in child class there will be 2 or more member with same name from inherited class.

## Virtual Base class:

#### To avoid ambiguity we can make the common base class as virtual base class.

## Container class:

#### Class consists of object of one class in another object.
